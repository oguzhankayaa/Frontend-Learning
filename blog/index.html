            After spending 3 years in Metu, now this is my last year.
            There will be lots of farewells to the dormitory,
            people, department and campus.

            Whilst Metu and Computer Engineering might be the best
            choice of my life, Metu Computer Engineering can be the worst one.
            Just kidding. I cannot know whether it is the best or the worst. 
            The only thing I knew is that Metu CEng developed me in many fields.

        <p class="post-paragraph">Giresun is the city I am from. 
        Its income is mainly from hazelnut agriculture. It is a very beautifull city with mountines and full of jungles.
        Lots of plateus and lots of villages. Famous places are Blue Lake, the City Museum, 
        the Castle, Kümbet Plateu and the Göksu Travertenleri. Also you should see some villages and see the view from top of them.
        I bet there is lots of antic cities under the jungle but it is very hard to find because of plant cover.
        </p>
        <p class="post-paragraph">
        I love this city.
        You know why? Well.. You should watch Vizontele</p>

        <p class="post-paragraph">I think using your old smartphone as much as possible has some benefits.
            One of them is that it reduces your time because of lack of software support and lack of hardware support.
            Also I think a smartphone should be a helper to a computer.
            It shouldn't have all the capabilities that a computer have.
